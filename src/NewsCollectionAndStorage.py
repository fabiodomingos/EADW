1) pull public news feed
2) identify 
3) collect new news items
4) store them in a common repository for further processing

- Notes:
The news collection should be performed on demand - invoking a function?
and new news items found should be added to the repository.

- Doubts to decide:
Where do we'll store the new items? Which platform/type/file?
Use sqlit3?
